## ❓ What is BetterTouchTool?

**BetterTouchTool (BTT)** is a powerful and flexible macOS utility designed to give users full control over how they interact with their Mac. With support for trackpads, mice, keyboards, and even the MacBook Touch Bar, BTT enables the creation of highly personalized gestures, shortcuts, automations, and visual elements that streamline your workflow and improve productivity.

At its core, BetterTouchTool lets you **redefine how your Mac responds to input**. You can assign custom actions to multi-finger gestures on the trackpad or magic mouse, map keyboard shortcuts globally or per app, and build completely custom Touch Bar interfaces that replace the default macOS layout with your own tools and widgets.

More advanced users can go even further by incorporating **AppleScript, shell scripts, JavaScript for Automation (JXA)**, or web triggers, allowing BetterTouchTool to serve as an automation hub similar to tools like Alfred or Keyboard Maestro.

One of the standout features is its **modular and intuitive interface**, which makes it easy to create complex configurations without writing a single line of code — though scripting is fully supported for power users. With real-time previews, drag-and-drop editors, and extensive documentation, both beginners and professionals can build powerful custom setups.

Whether you're a **developer, designer, video editor, or productivity enthusiast**, BetterTouchTool provides the tools to optimize your setup, reduce repetitive tasks, and gain full control over macOS interactions.

The app is fully compatible with **macOS Sonoma**, **Ventura**, **Monterey**, and optimized for **Apple Silicon (M1, M2, M3)** chips, ensuring fast, responsive performance on modern hardware.

From launching apps and resizing windows to controlling music or triggering complex workflows — **BetterTouchTool makes your Mac feel truly yours**.
